================= STEP TWO: PROJECT PROPOSAL=========================
=======================================================================

	We are moving forward with the PokeDex idea for a website

The main goal of the website will be to get all that data from the API with a search that would display on a normal PokeDex. The sub goals are:
  Design a PokeDex Shell
  Look into voice reading the pokemon information
  Make a log in to save favorite pokemon for a list.
  
The demographic of the site should be pokemon enthusiasts, all ages, with functionality for children as young as 5 to adults.
The types, numbers, attributes, and general data on pokemon searched.

Approach outline:
  Should have a table with usernames and passwords.  Another table associated with list of favorite pokemon / rank / usernames.  Maybe a 
  third table with teams of 6 pokemon.
  
I need the api to work and have full data, I will not know the exact issues in isolating data until I run tests on it and try to work with it.

The user names and logins if I go with that approach.

The app should be able to pull up information, maybe even filter information or at least put it in an easy to read through format with a user friendly appearance.

Flow?  User login should be in the forefront as well as the ability to make an account.  Should then pull their names as well as the list of favorites if they have them and their teams saved on the side.  Then have a search pokedex information with a drawn / animated pokedex to type in information.  Should access the API and return information displaying the search, with options to go to next pokemon or maybe next pokemon in a filter, or pull from types/ attributes / numbers / weaknesses.  The ability to save them under list names or team names is an option.

Iâ€™m not 100% sure what stretch goals are.
